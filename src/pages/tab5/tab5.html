<h5>So what can I say about my soft skills?</h5>

<h6>Work ethic</h6>
<p>I tend to have positive attitude to work, I never say "no can do" but instead I will ask "when do you need it?" and work on getting projects done by the deadline.
  If I don't know something already, I go extra mile to figure out a solution to any possible problems. I can work both independently and on a team and I have experience on both.
 Should the need arise I can take up leadership roles, but I'm perfectly fine with letting other people lead too.</p>
 <h6>Communication skills</h6>
 <p>I can easily communicate using either English or Finnish and I have no problems working with either language. I have ability to express myself fine with each language and I tend to do so in a calm, confident manner. When need to, I'm not afraid to ask necessary questions.
