    I have developed various Ionic programs at Laurea University of Applied sciences that used both Ionic and AngularJS. I also have qualifications for HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap and Javascript with understanding of REST API and JSON. I believe I would be great asset to your team. In addition to skills required by your job my experiences include C#, C++, C and
    production of various projects, either for myself or for clients.
